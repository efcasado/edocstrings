edocstrings
===========

A `docstring` is a string literal that occurs as the first expression
in a function.

```erl
-module(math2).

-export([math/2]).

sum(A, B) ->
    "Returns the sum of the two provided numbers.",
    A + B.
```

Docstrings can be accessed by invoking the `<MODULE>:help(<FUNCTION>,
<ARITY>)` function.

In the example above, `sum/2`'s docstring can be accessed by calling
`math2:help(sum, 2)`, which returns the `"Returns the sum of the two
provided numbers."` string literal.

```erl
math2:help(sum, 2).
"Returns the sum of the two provided numbers."
```


## Usage

If you want to use docstrings in your Erlang project, all you need to
do is add `edocstring` as a dependency and make sure you compile your
erlang modules using the `edocstrings`'s parse transform.

You can enable the `edocstring_ptransform` parse transform on an
individual Erlang module by using the `-compile(<COMPILE_OPTION>)`
module attribute.

```erl
-module(math2).

-compile({parse_transform, edocstring_ptransform}).

-export([math/2]).

sum(A, B) ->
    "Returns the sum of the two provided numbers.",
    A + B.
```

Alternatively, you can tell the Erlang compiler that you want to use
the `edocstrings`'s parse transform by using the
`+{parse_transform,edocstrings_ptransform}` compile option when
invoking the Erlang compiler.
